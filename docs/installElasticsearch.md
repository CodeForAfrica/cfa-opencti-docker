# Elasticsearch Cluster Setup on Ubuntu Server

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to install and configure an Elasticsearch cluster on Ubuntu servers. Elasticsearch is a powerful open-source search and analytics engine that enables you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data in near real-time.

## Prerequisites

- One or more Ubuntu servers (20.04 or later) with SSH access.
- Sudo or root privileges on the servers.
- At least 3 servers (2 Cores 8GB RAM 20GB Space or more recommended for production environments).


## Installation

### 1. Install Elasticsearch

You can invoke this script or alternatively visit the official [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/deb.html):

```bash
./scripts/es_install_script

```

### 2. Configure the cluster

# Elasticsearch Node Configuration Example

This section outlines the necessary modifications for the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` located on each node of your cluster. Replace the placeholder values with those specific to your environment.


1. In node 1, open the elasticsearch.yml file in a text editor with sudo privileges, for example:
```bash

sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
```
2. Replace the placeholders in the configuration file with actual values that suit your setup.

```yaml
# Path to Elasticsearch configuration file: /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml

# Common cluster name for all nodes
cluster.name: "opencti_cluster"

# Unique node name for each node
node.name: "node-1"  # Change "node-1" to a unique name per node

# Network configuration
network.host: ens5-ip  # Set to the actual IP or hostname

# Discovery settings
discovery.seed_hosts: ["ens5-ip-1", "ens5-ip-2"]  # List IP addresses of master and data nodes
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["node-1", "node-2"]  # List initial master nodes
```
3. Save and close the file.

4. Restart Elasticsearch to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
```

5. Log in to one of your existing Elasticsearch node-1.
6. Run the following command to create an enrollment token:

   ```bash
   /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node
   ```

# Using an Elasticsearch Enrollment Token

This section explains how to use a generated enrollment token for a new Elasticsearch node and how to use this token to configure the node as part of your cluster.

## Generating an Enrollment Token

Once you have your enrollment token, you can use it to configure a new node in your Elasticsearch cluster. Perform these steps on the new node:

1. Ensure Elasticsearch is installed on the new node but not yet started.
2. Run the following command to configure the node with the enrollment token:

```bash
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reconfigure-node --enrollment-token <enrollment-token>

```
Replace <enrollment-token> with the token generated in the previous steps.
Start Elasticsearch on the new node:
```bash
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
```

After executing these steps, the new node should be configured and connected to your Elasticsearch cluster.

# Verification
To verify that the new node has successfully joined the cluster, run the following command on any of the cluster nodes:

```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_cat/nodes?v=true&pretty"
```
